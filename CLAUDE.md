# Development Notes for Claude

## Running the Website Locally

To test/view the website locally with auto-refresh:
```bash
live-server --port=8000
```
This will automatically open your browser and refresh when files change.

Alternative (basic server without auto-refresh):
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open `http://localhost:8000` in browser.
