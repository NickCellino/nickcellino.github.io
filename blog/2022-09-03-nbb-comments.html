    <h1>
      Implementing a comments feature for my blog with nbb, htmx, Serverless Framework, and DynamoDB
    </h1>

    <p>
    TLDR: here's the repo <a href="https://github.com/NickCellino/nbb-comments">https://github.com/NickCellino/nbb-comments</a>. Usage instructions are in the README. Scroll down to the end of this post to see the comments feature in action.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recently, I've been trying to work on writing more (on this blog in particular). I thought it would be more fun and interactive if people could leave comments on my posts. I know, very novel. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I've also been trying to learn and get better at Clojure so I thought "why not build my own comments feature in Clojure, then write about it on my blog?". So that's what I did.
    </p>

    <h2> My Goals </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Build a comments feature that is easy to integrate into my website, which is hosted on Github pages and does not have a dedicated backend
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow users to leave comments easily (without making an account or requiring social login or anything like that)
      </li>
      <li>
        Implement some mechanism to prevent bots from sending in spam comments
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      I'm aware that without logins, normal users can easily spam me with excessive comments and lie about who they are. We'll see if that becomes a problem. But if we can't trust anonymous strangers on the internet, then who can we trust, really?
    </p>

    <h2> How it works </h2>

    <p>
    The comments service runs on an AWS Lambda function. The Lambda runs ClojureScript code which is made possible by <a href="https://github.com/babashka/nbb">nbb</a>. nbb makes it possible to execute ClojureScript within a NodeJS environment and with some <a href="https://blog.michielborkent.nl/aws-lambda-nbb.html">very simple wiring up</a>, you can run this in a Lambda function. The Lambda function interacts with a database in DynamoDB in order to store and retrieve comments, grouped by their blog post ids.
    </p>

    <h3>Express & htmx</h3>

    <p>
    I used <a href="https://expressjs.com/">express</a> in my Lambda to handle routing requests to the few different endpoints that I have setup:
      <ol>
        <li> <strong>GET /comments-form?post-id=[post_id]</strong>: returns the HTML for the "add a comment" form </li>
        <li> <strong>GET /comments?post-id=[post_id]</strong>: returns the list of comments for the specified blog post, rendered as HTML </li>
        <li> <strong>POST /comments</strong>: saves a comment to DynamoDB and returns the newly saved comment, rendered as HTML </li>
      </ol>

      The code to set that up looks something like this:
      <pre>(ns express
  (:require ["express$default" :as express]))

(defn create-app
  [{:keys [allowed-origin-url] :as config}]
  (let [app (express)]
    (.use app (.urlencoded express #js {:extended true}))
    (.use app (fn [_ res next]
                (doto res
                  (.set "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" allowed-origin-url)
                  (.set "Access-Control-Allow-Methods" "GET, POST")
                  (.set "Access-Control-Allow-Headers" "hx-trigger, hx-target, hx-request, hx-current-url"))
                (next)))

    (.get app "/comments" (get-comments-handler config))
    (.post app "/comments" (post-comment-handler config))
    (.get app "/comments-form" (get-comments-form-handler config))

    app))</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
    I used <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a> to make the frontend interactive and dynamic without having to write any sort of frontend DOM-manipulation JS. (I highly recommend you check out htmx if you've never heard of it. It's sort of an alternative to the React/Angular/Vue style SPA frameworks everyone is using these days for building dynamic frontend applications. <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/">Their essays</a> are also really good reads from the few I've read so far.)
    </p>

    <p>
    The way that works is basically: certain elements of the DOM are marked with <code>hx-&ltattr&gt</code> which give them certain dynamic properties. For example, in our HTML, where we want to load in the comments list, we add:

    <pre>&lt;div
  id=&quot;comments-list&quot;
  hx-get=&quot;http://localhost:3000/comments?post-id=example-post-id&quot;
  hx-swap=&quot;innerHTML&quot;
  hx-trigger=&quot;load&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

    This says, "on page load, do an HTTP GET to 'http://localhost:3000/comments?post-id=example-post-id' and replace the innerHTML of this div with what comes back".
    </p>
    <p>
    The <code>get-comments-handler</code> function from our express example above delegates that request to a function that looks like <code>get-comments</code> below:
    <pre>(defn serialize-comment
  [comment-body]
  (let [author (if (any [nil? empty?] (:author comment-body))
                 "Anonymous"
                 (:author comment-body))
        author-section [:p {:class "name"} [:strong author] "said..."]
        message-section [:p {:class "message"} (:message comment-body)]
        date-section [:p {:class "datetime"} (format-iso-date (:time comment-body))]]
    [:div {:class "comment"} author-section message-section date-section]))

(defn get-comments
  "Retrieves a list of comments as HTML."
  [config post-id]
  (promesa/let [cmts (comments-repo/get-comments config post-id)
                html-comments (map serialize-comment cmts)]
    (hiccup/html html-comments)))</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
    So the backend returns the list of comments to the frontend, rendered as HTML and htmx does the work to update the DOM without any fancy frontend frameworks. I think that's pretty cool.
    </p>

    <h3>Comment storage</h3>
    <p>
    One technique I used here to make this easier to develop was I first built the whole thing running locally without any reliance on AWS infrastructure. I generally like to do this if possible when I am using AWS because it makes the feedback loop much, much faster. This is a really basic example of the usefulness of polymorphism, which Clojure multimethods are great for.
    </p>
    <p>
    For example, the <code>get-comments</code> function is a multimethod that dispatches on the <code>:repo</code> value for its first argument:
    <pre>(defmulti get-comments :repo)</pre>
    The "local" implementation of this just returns an in-memory vector:

    <pre>(def comments (atom []))

(defn list-comments
  [post-id]
  (reverse (filter #(= (:post-id %) post-id) @comments)))

(defmethod repo/get-comments :local
  [_ post-id]
  (list-comments post-id))</pre>

    The DynamoDB implementation of this obviously has to do a little more work, and this approach made it easy to swap that in once I was ready to focus on that part.
    </p>

    <p>

    <h3> Recaptcha </h3>
    <p>
      I used <a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3">Google reCAPTCHA v3</a> to try to thwart bot abuse in a way that is not annoying to normal users. reCAPTCHA v3 is nice because it does not require any action on the part of the user- it all happens in the background. When the user tries to save a comment, the frontend submits a reCAPTCHA token with the request. If the reCAPTCHA score is below a certain threshold, the backend responds with an error and doesn't save the comment.
    </p>

    <h3>Closing thoughts</h3>
    <p>
    The DynamoDB table and AWS Lambda configuration are packaged up in a <code>serverless.yml</code> file (used by Serverless Framework) so if you like, you can easily deploy your own instance to your own AWS account.
    </p>

    <p>
      And that's pretty much how it works. Check out the code <a href="https://github.com/NickCellino/nbb-comments">here</a> if you want to dig into the nitty gritty. There's instructions in there for how you can deploy it in your own AWS environment and/or run it locally. And check out the end product below.
