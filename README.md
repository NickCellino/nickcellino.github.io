# Nick Cellino's Website

Personal website hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Local Development

To run the website locally with auto-refresh:

```bash
live-server --port=8000
```

This will automatically open your browser and refresh when files change.

Alternative (basic server without auto-refresh):
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
